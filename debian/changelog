zope-pluggableuserfolder (2.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New features:
    - PluggableUser now implements property handling (needed for CPS3)
    - The LDAPAuthenticationPlugin is now read/write.
  * Bug fixes:
    - Compatibility with LDAPUserGroupsFolder was buggy.
    - InternalAuthentication search did not handle '*' searches.
    - Group plugins can now delete groups!
    - Doing a CPSDirectory search on members now work again.
    - Searching in roles now work again.
    - Role oplugins are no longer required to take care of inheritance
      themselves. This is probably inefficient, but makes for neater code.
