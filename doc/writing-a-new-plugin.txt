Yeah, as you noticed, there is no documentation on how to write
plugins yet. Sorry about that.

However, it should be quite easy to make an SQL Plugin. I would
try to make a plugin that has a set of Z SQL Methods. One for
getting user data, one for changing user data, one for adding a
user and one for deleting a user.

Then take a look at how InternalAuthentication plugin works, and
every time it looks in it's dictionary of user objects, you would
instead call the proper Z SQL Method.
