Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- InternalAuthentication.py: Fix bug found by unit test: add
  acquisition wrapper to user returned by getUser().
- PluggableUserFolder.py: Fixed a serious bug that made
  SimpleIdentification fail unless it was first in line.
- SimpleGroupRoles.py: If the role attrubute was set to None, this
  plugin failed. Now it handles any kind of "emptyness", like None,
  '', or {} equally.
- InternalAuthentication.py: getUsers must also wrap the users.
