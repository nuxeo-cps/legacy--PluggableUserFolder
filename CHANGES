ZODB Requires:

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed a spelling error

- SimpleGroupsRoles has a bug when calling AcquiredGroups.

- getGroupsForUser returned a list. Some CMF/CPS code assumed it
  to be a tuple, so I changed that.

New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The magic _v_acl_users is no longer used, instead, Acquisition is
  used to find the userfolder. This requires all plugins to make sure
  that the user is properly acquisition wrapped before returning it.
