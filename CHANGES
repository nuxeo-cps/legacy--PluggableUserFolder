ZODB Requires:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- CookieAuthentication can now be prevented from sending the password as a
  cookie. This prevents both the password being sent every request, as well
  as it's storage as a cookie on the client. Doing this is not compatible with
  ZEO, however, so it is only invoked when "ZEO Combatibility" is unchecked.
  
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- The clever Acquisition wrapping of LDAP users did not work. This prevented
  LDAP users from getting roles from groups.

New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The wrapping of the user in the user folder is now done by the user folder,
  and not by the plugin.
