ZODB Requires:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Having NuxUserGroups / UserFolderWithGroups installed together
  with PluggableUserFolder is no longer supported.

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Full group plugins support.
- A SimpleGroups plugin that works as most Zope groups.
- CPS support for Simple Groups, giving PluggableUserFolder equal CPS
  functionality as UserFolderWithGroups

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix copyright attribution

New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- All modules now take their logging imports from PluggableUserFolder.
  If you set the environment variable ZOPE_PLUGGABLE_LOGGING to OFF it
  will in turn replace the LOG() method with a method of it's own that
  simply passes on everything, so no logging happens.
  This way, you can use PluggableUserFolder and have the log level
  set to debug without PluggableUserFolder drowning out your DEBUG
  messages.
- A new object PluggableUserWrapper is created. This is used when you want
  to wrap an existing UserFolder that uses it's own user classes, like
  LDAPUserFolder.
